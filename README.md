# GramControl â€“ Block Instagram Distractions

![gram-control](Design/marketplace/marquee.png)


GramControl removes the unnecessary distractions of Instagram and lets you, once again, enjoy connecting with your friends and community.

Currently we support the following customizable options with more to come:

- Hides Instagram Explore and Reels links
- Hides suggested posts and recommendations from your feed
- Hides comments from posts
- Hides suggested friends sections

GramControl is open-source, lightweight, reliable, and intuitive. It never saves, sends, or uses any of your information for purposes other than its core functionality.

## Install Locally (Chrome)

1. Download the latest .zip file version from [https://github.com/Thinkorswim/gram-control/releases](https://github.com/Thinkorswim/gram-control/releases)
2. Unzip the file and you should have a folder `gramcontrol-chrome`
3. Move the folder to a permanent location on your computer (do not delete the folder after installation).
4. Go to the extensions page: chrome://extensions
5. Enable Developer Mode (toggle "Developer mode" at the top-right corner)
6. Click Load unpacked and select/open the extension folder (contains file manifest.json).


## Developer setup

The project is based on the [WXT Framework](https://wxt.dev/) with Vite and React. To start development or build from source follow the steps below:

1. Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Clone the repository 

```
git clone https://github.com/Thinkorswim/gram-control.git
``` 

3. Install dependencies 

```
cd gram-control/GramControl
npm install
```

4. Run the project

```
npm run dev
```

5. (Optional) Create a build from source

```
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder which can be loaded unpacked into your browser extensions. Hot reloading development is available.
